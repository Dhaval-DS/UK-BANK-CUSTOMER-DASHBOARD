## Features / Highlights

### Business Problem
Financial institutions need a clear and consolidated view of their customer portfolio to drive growth and improve service delivery. Without an effective visualization tool, answering critical questions is difficult. For instance:
* Which region holds the highest customer base and total balance?
* What is the financial profile of different customer job segments?
* Which demographic groups (age, gender) have the highest average balance?
* How does customer activity vary across different quarters?

### Goal of the Dashboard
To create an intuitive, interactive tool that allows stakeholders to:
* Quickly identify and understand the key characteristics of the customer base.
* Filter and segment customers by region, job type, gender, and age.
* Uncover insights related to customer balance and demographics to support strategic planning.

### Business Impact & Insights
* **Market Focus:** With over 53% of both the customer count and total balance originating from England, it is clearly the bank's most critical market.
